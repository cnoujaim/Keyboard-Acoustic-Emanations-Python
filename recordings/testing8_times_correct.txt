For more than 15 years, the wine panel has been celebrating Thanksgiving early. We gather over a representative holiday meal to examine how a variety of wines will fare at the feast.

Over time we have learned a few things that ought to come as a relief to all who sweat the task of picking wines for the holiday.

Hereâ€™s the most important thing: To muck this up, you will have to try really hard. Even if you do, everything will still turn out fine. In general, people come to Thanksgiving for the joy of joining their family and friends and re-enacting the annual rituals. Good food and wine is extra pleasure.

Even if the food and drink are not so great, it will not matter. Only one sin can mar this holiday: Running out of either.
