Keyboard Acoustic Emanations but make it Python

Abstract
We show that keyboards are vulnerable to attacks based on differentiating the sounds emanated by each individual key press. We present Kreeper, a method to extract secret information from recorded keystrokes. Our attack automatically detects key presses, extracts features, classifies keystrokes using audio data, and corrects classification using a language model. With our automated methods, we achieve 88.8% character level accuracy and 46.1% word level accuracy. With human-intervention methods, we achieve 91.3% character level accuracy and 88.2% word level accuracy.
